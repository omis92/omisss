      "Content":"Take advantage of the roguelite design The biggest key to avoiding frustration with Back 4 Blood’s difficulty is understanding how its design differs from Left 4 Dead. You aren’t meant to beat this campaign on Veteran or higher difficulty on your first try, even if you’re the most grizzled of Left 4 Dead veterans. Back 4 Blood uses a deck building system, similar to what you’d see in many roguelite games. The first time you face the campaign, and particularly the much more difficult second half, you’re likely to run into trouble. The default, prebuilt deck will only get you so far. You'll need the best cards if you want to survive until the end. Thankfully, you can use Supply Lines to unlock more cards and build better decks. After that, you can restart the campaign from the last level you reached with a fresh set of continues and an improved deck. Push as far as you can, upgrade your deck, and go again. Eventually, you’ll make it to the end of the campaign, unless you get dealt a particularly brutal Corruption Card."

      "Content":"Pick the right team Another key difference from Left 4 Dead is the character system. Back 4 Blood’s cast has more than just witty quips up their sleeves. Each character brings unique abilities to the table to help themselves and their team. For example, Walker increases everyone's health, whilst Evangelo and Holly increase team speed and stamina respectively. Every character is solid, and you can play to their strengths through deck building. However, on Nightmare difficulty, you’re going to need the best team you can get. We’ve got a guide to the best characters in Back 4 Blood to help you and your team stay alive."

      "Content":"Understanding weapon attachments More Left 4 Dead differences! Back 4 Blood has more complicated weapons, which include attachment slots you can modify over the course of a campaign. Attachments can be purchased at the buy station in each safe house or found over the course of a campaign. Most of these are straightforward and include descriptions of the stats they provide. There are over 30 weapons to choose from, so check out the best weapons in Back 4 Blood if you need help narrowing down the selection."

      "Content":"Some weapons found on the ground will also have broken attachments that have stat penalties instead of bonuses. Keep an eye out for red attachments; these are the broken ones. Unfortunately, you can’t just pop them off either. If you find an attachment for the same slot though, you can replace the damaged part. I’ve seen a lot of players wondering how to remove weapon attachments in Back 4 Blood, and this is the only way right now."

       "Content":"The Hocker/Stinger is the replacement for the hunter from Left 4 Dead, but with more trapping uses. These four-armed monsters spit a glob of phlegm at cleaners to keep them trapped in one spot. If caught, you need to go to your ally and melee them so they can move freely again. They will not be able to shoot like shown in the reveal trailer. As of this writing, we have not seen a stinger land a pounce, so we do not know if they stay on top of survivors and claw at their health until knocked off like the hunter does, but the way they jump around is very similar to the hooded special infected from Left 4 Dead, although it can stick to walls."

       "Content":"This special infected type has only been referred to as a Retch. These bulking enemies are similar to a combination of the Spitter and Boomer from Left 4 Dead. They projectile vomit acid at players that will do damage over time and have a chance to alert the horde to your presence. When killed, they explode unless you hit them with headshots."

       "Content":"Tall Boy/Bruiser :  Referred to as Tallboys or Bruisers, these vertically-gifted special infected slam their giant club onto the ground, which puts out a shockwave effect on anyone near impact. If too close, you will be thrown back with a significant chunk of damage. Its weak spot is a bulging blister on its big arm that will completely remove the arm from the enemy when exploded. If you do not put damage into that area, it will take quite a bit longer to kill these guys."

      "Content":"Ogre : The Ogre seems like a much more dangerous and deadly version of the Tank from Left 4 Dead. This is the beast that is 20 feet tall and slowly makes its way after survivors, eating bullets for what seems like forever. These guys are bullet sponges and will take so much of your resources to take down. Luckily, they are slow and you can run from them until you reach an area they cannot enter. Do not get complacent though, they will reach into smaller areas to grab you and throw you across the room for a huge amount of damage."

      "Content":"Snitch: Snitches are long necked enemies that will call the horde when they are damaged. They put out a piercing scream and can turn a tame situation into something hectic very quickly. Whenever this special infected receives any damage, you want to take it out quickly before it can call a horde. Of our playtime so far, besides the Ogre, this special infected appears the least amount of times thankfully."

      "Content":"At the start of every level, Back 4 Blood’s AI director draws Corruption Cards that modify the difficulty of the campaign. This is especially impactful in the second half of the campaign, where the Director draws five cards instead of two. It’s a big component of the difficulty, and it’s easy to get caught off-guard if you aren’t paying attention. If you missed an Armored Bruisers draw at the start of a level, you may find yourself dumping ammo into a protected weak spot to little effect. That’s a great way to get crushed and die. Read the Corruption Cards carefully so you know what to expect."
