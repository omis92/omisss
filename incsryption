If you have a new strategy, fell free to leave a comment about it and I’ll add a new section for it, crediting you for the strategy. Endless Scrapyard Required Cards 1x Energy Conduit 1x Steel Mice 1x Bone Heap 1x Any conduit card (I recommend a Factory Conduit) Setup Reach 4 maximum energy. Have the above cards in your hand. Play your conduit cards to the left-most and right-most lanes to activate the Energy Conduit. Grind Destroy any of your cards in the inner-left and inner-right lanes with the hammer. Play Steel Mice to any empty space without losing energy due to the activated Energy Conduit and keep a copy of Steel Mice due to its effect. Continue until a satisfactory quantity of bones have been farmed in the same turn. Final Blow Destroy all your remaining cards with the hammer. Play Bone Heap to any space that will allow it to directly attack. Activate the ability of Bone Heap until you can no longer afford the bone cost. End your turn and watch as your Bone Heap deal an absurd amount of overkill damage in a single blow."

Inscryption 100% Achievements & Secrets in ActsInscryption 100% Achievements & Secrets in Acts Inscryption 100% Achievements & Secrets in Acts Squirrel Wrangler Win a battle with damage from Squirrels. There are 2 easy ways to do that. 1. First way is to get the Amalgama creature (rare one) as a reward after boss fights or for golden pelts. This creature counts represents all of the factions at once including the squirrel one. So it IS the squirrel technically. That’s how I got the achievement (the screenshot from the moment achievement popped up is down below) 2. Another reliable way is to create a totem that gives squirrels a sigil to grow in power after 1 turn.3. You can also do some genius plays with cards that increase power of adjacent cards. But I’d strongly recommend you to use the 1st method.

So, in Act II, obtain an Ouroboros.Then go to the mage tower, and reach the second floor, when you can battle the dummy.You can play an infinite game against it, and the basic idea is to keep crashing (hammer tool on the left) your ouroboros and summon it again, more and more powerful.But how to deal with the limited number of sacrifices?One solution may be to fill the deck with cats. But there is a limited number of deaths they can endure. A better permanent solution is the Tomb Robber, a rare undead card, that allow to summon a skeleton in your hand spending one bone. So if you have 2 bones and the Tomb Robber on the field, you can summon 2 skeletons. Then you play them. And sacrifice them to play Ouroboros. This sacrifice has given you 2 new bones, that you can use to summon two more skeletons. So, break you ouroboros with the hammer and start again, until you are bored!"
